3 Apps I love using:

1. Waffle
   - Allows users to create multiple shared journals for different groups
   - Generates AI questions based on previous entries to make journaling more facilitated on less eventful days
   - You can pick cute journal covers
3. Reddit
   - Users can maintain anonyminity
   - You can choose to stay in your own bubble or explore what is popular
   - The avatars are fun to customize
5. Papa John's
   -The animations when you make pizza are cute
   -Its very easy to navigate deals
   -You can add multiple payment methods

App I would like to build:

SustainaGO helps users connect with the environment around them especially when touring new cities during travel. Instead of suggesting tourist traps that gain mass traction leading to over-tourism, our app will suggest more national parks and small locally funded events that are eco-friendly and raise awareness. There is a community tab to help build countless connections with not only your community but with strangers from around the states who wish to gain more exposure to their town/city. Not only can users find new events from here, but they can also add them directly to their future itinerary when planning to visit the city in the near future.
